 Keys
======

This repository contains SSH keys (and in the future, maybe others)
used for accessing the Sepia lab.

SSH keys are stored as ``ssh/USER.pub``. A group called ``@all`` is
automatically provided, that contains keys for all the known users.

After updating keys, run ``./update``

You use these keys by setting in ``/etc/ssh/ssh_import_id``::

	URL='https://raw.github.com/ceph/keys/autogenerated/ssh/%s.pub'

and then running::

	ssh-import-id USER

or::

	ssh-import-id @all
